# nounou-de-reve-mobile-App.
This project was developped for my wife which is childminder (nounou in French!) <br>
The App help her to record/track his working hours. <br>
She can manage several childrens arriving and leaving at differente every days hours every days.<br>
So to replace his small piece of paper and penâ€¦. I create this mobile app. with Flutter.<br>

She can select the children from the main page<br>

Data are loaded into a google sheeet, so quite easy to totalize at the end of the month or make analysis at the end of the year.  

App is working, (not 100% finalized) <br>
It was my first mobile application, code is not clean and content a lot of personal information,<br>
<br>
So it will not be public, but if you have question or if you are interrested by the code, just ask me.
